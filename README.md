This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in Tcl programming:  the unexpected behavior of the `==` operator when comparing numbers. The `==` operator in Tcl performs string comparison, not numerical comparison.  This means that `1` (an integer) and `1.0` (a floating point number) will be considered unequal because they are represented differently as strings. The `bug.tcl` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.tcl` demonstrates the correct way to perform numeric comparisons using the `expr` command.
